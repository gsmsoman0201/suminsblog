                <p>Rosenthal center for contempory art is in Cincinnati, 
                    Ohio and was designed by Zaha Hadid from 1997 to 2003. 
                    The architecture provides space for exhibits, installations, 
                    and performances. 
                    The users of the building are people of Cincinnati, artists,

                        Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art is unlike other Zaha 
                        Hadid’s projects, which were futuristic and avant-gardistic, sits
                         modestly in downtown of Cincinnati, yet still achieves the 
                         imaginative possibility of architecture. Unlike Guggenheim, 
                         Rosenthal center cuts in between the circulation and the art 
                         installations. It shouldn’t be compared to other gallery since 
                         there are no fixed exhibit, so it’s better to view as a tourist 
                         attraction for people to enjoy architecture.

                    Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art is completely 
                    in the middle of downtown Cincinnati, which is urban
                     area. Moreover, we can observe that  downtown of
                      Cincinnati is totally planned city plan since 
                      streets are in straight grids. Also, there was 
                      few more complex cultural space, such as museums, 
                      art centers, libraries. There seems to be a 
                      interstate highway going through the downtown of 
                      Cincinnati, which is unique feature of American 
                      cities.

                Zaha Hadid considered accessibility as one of the important aspect in designing the building. This was one of the first major project. Before then she was known as “paper architect.” She says that fluidity, which is her major characteristic in designing a building, came from her Arab heritage. Her plan for Cardiff Bay Opera house fell apart by many criticism by tabloid magazine. Problem with the Rosenthal Center was that 11000 sqft was a small space to work with, and it was in the corner of a street, so idea of nesting came from having to have different kinds of spaces in small work area. After construction, it had great reviews of the architecture.

                <p>
                    My dad had a chance to go see this masterpiece on his business trip. He said that it was really different style of usual Zaha Hadid’s architecture, for example DDP in Seoul, South Korea. Exterior looked like big chunk of block was just on top of each other like a lego.

                    Main idea for the contemporary art center was to build a very welcoming structure and make art accessible to diverse population. So she made a concept called ‘urban carpet.’ For example, the building has its entrance in the streets and not having to go up the giant stairs. In other words, people could just ‘walk in’ to the center. To break the paradigm of museums being “white cube,” she designed the building as 3D jigsaw puzzle to create all kinds of different spaces. She does great job in incorporating the fact that contemporary art doesn’t just expand horizontally but in 3-dimentionally.

                    Author claims that architecture can be a catalyst for instigating and influencing the process of making, as well as viewing, art. I definitely agree with the author. The space, which person is standing has effect on the experience one is having within the space. It could amplify the emotions and perceptions when viewing art.
